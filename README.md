# Coursera-Specializations

Coursera is an American online learning platform founded in 2012 by Stanford professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller that offers massive open online courses (MOOC), specializations, and degrees.

**An Introduction to Programming the Internet of Things (IOT) Specialization**
***Specialization Link:*** [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot?](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/iot?)
***About:***  Design, create, and deploy a fun IoT device using Arduino and Raspberry Pi platforms.
This Specialization covers embedded systems, the Raspberry Pi Platform, and the Arduino environment for building devices that can control the physical world. In the final Capstone Project, you’ll apply the skills you learned by designing, building, and testing a microcontroller-based embedded system, producing a unique final project suitable for showcasing to future employers.

**Programming with Google Go Specialization**
***Specialization Link:*** [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang)
***About:***  This specialization introduces the Go programming language from Google and provides learners with an overview of Go's special features. Upon completing the three-course sequence, learners will have gained the knowledge and skills needed to create concise, efficient, and clean applications using Go.

***Certification:*** 


**Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization**
***Specialization Link:*** [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms)
***About:***  This specialization is a mix of theory and practice: you will learn algorithmic techniques for solving various computational problems and will implement about 100 algorithmic coding problems in a programming language of your choice. No other online course in  **Algorithms**  even comes close to offering you a wealth of  **programming challenges**  that you may face at your next job interview. To prepare you, we invested over 3000 hours into designing our challenges as an alternative to multiple choice questions that you usually find in MOOCs. Sorry, we do not believe in multiple choice questions when it comes to learning algorithms...or anything else in computer science! For each algorithm you develop and implement, we designed multiple tests to check its correctness and running time — you will have to debug your programs without even knowing what these tests are! It may sound difficult, but we believe it is the only way to truly understand how the algorithms work and to master the art of programming. The specialization contains two real-world projects:  **Big Networks**  and  **Genome Assembly**. You will analyze both road networks and social networks and will learn how to compute the shortest route between New York and San Francisco (1000 times faster than the standard shortest path algorithms!) Afterwards, you will learn how to assemble genomes from millions of short fragments of DNA and how assembly algorithms fuel recent developments in personalized medicine.

***Certification:*** 

**Python for Everybody Specialization**
***Specialization Link:*** [https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)
***About:***  This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, you’ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.
